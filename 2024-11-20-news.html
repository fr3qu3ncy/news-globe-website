        <p><i> A young woman in a Ukrainian winter landscape stands amidst fallen snow-covered trees, with a cityscape of Kyiv burning in the background as a Russian tank emerges from the smoke, while a group of One Direction band members mournfully hold a funeral procession for Liam Payne in the foreground. Donald Trump stands confidently beside Dr. Oz, both dressed formally and surrounded by news headlines about rising energy bills and inflation. In the top-left corner, a Met police officer is shown being investigated over a car crash death, while a lawyer consults with women planning to sue talc manufacturers below. Logan Paul sits on a couch looking dejected amidst news articles about crypto scams, as a priest stands in front of a church now converted into a music video set for Sabrina Carpenter. </i></p>
