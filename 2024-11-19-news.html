        <h1>2024-11-19</h1>
        <p>Here is a summary of the news headlines:</br></br>* Turkish strikes in Syria cut water supply to 1 million people</br>* A car driven into a crowd outside a primary school in China has been captured on video</br>* The US has appointed a new Transport Secretary, Sean Duffy, who previously hosted a Fox News show</br>* Ukraine has fired long-range missiles supplied by the US into Russia, according to Ukraine's defence ministry</br>* Germany suspects sabotage behind severed underwater cables</p>
        <p><i> A war-torn cityscape in Syria with a massive crater in the ground from a Turkish airstrike, surrounded by rubble and debris. In the distance, a convoy of military vehicles drives through a dry and barren landscape where a once-thriving oasis is now a desolate wasteland devoid of water due to the cut supply affecting over 1 million people. Above this scene, a chaotic crowd in China surges through the streets as a car careens out of control towards them, the driver's face twisted with desperation. In a contrasting tone, a bespectacled Sean Duffy stands confidently in front of an American flag, his arms crossed and a hint of a smile on his face, while a smoldering wildfire erupts behind him. Meanwhile, a Ukrainian missile streaks across the sky towards Russia as the German underwater cables lie severed and tangled at the bottom of the ocean, their ends frayed and damaged, with evidence of sabotage scattered nearby. </i></p>
