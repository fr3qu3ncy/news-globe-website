        <p><i> "A chaotic cityscape in Mandy Pattullo's style, with Turkish artillery strikes causing destruction in the background, as a car driven into a crowd of people outside a primary school in China descends into chaos, amidst a sea of worried faces and emergency responders rushing to the scene, while in the distance a former US President Donald Trump watches from afar as his newly appointed Transportation Secretary, Sean Duffy, proudly stands next to a convoy of US-supplied long-range missiles being fired into Russian territory by Ukraine's military, all set against a backdrop of a major water treatment plant damaged beyond repair, affecting over 1 million people, with the resulting devastation and destruction radiating outward in all directions." </i></p>
