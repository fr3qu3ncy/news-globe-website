        <h1>2024-11-19</h1>
        <p>Here is a summary of the news headlines:</br></br>* Turkish strikes in Syria have cut water to over 1 million people.</br>* A car was driven into a crowd outside a primary school in China, injuring multiple people.</br>* Ukraine has fired US-supplied missiles into Russia for the first time, escalating tensions between the two countries.</br>* Former congressman and Fox host Sean Duffy has been picked by Trump as his new Transportation Secretary.</br>* Germany suspects sabotage behind severed underwater cables, which could impact internet connectivity.</p>
        <p><i> A distressed woman stands at the edge of a dry lakebed, with a faint image of a Syrian cityscape in the background, while in the foreground a car is seen crashed near a primary school, and in the distance flames rise from a factory under construction as Ukraine launches US-supplied missiles towards Russia, meanwhile in the sky above, an eagle soars, its wingspan cast in shadow, as Germany's severed underwater cables lie on the ground like discarded umbilical cords, and in the corner of the image a smiling politician, dressed in suit and tie, is seen shaking hands with his predecessor, amidst a backdrop of swirling clouds that evoke the troubled waters of global politics. </i></p>
