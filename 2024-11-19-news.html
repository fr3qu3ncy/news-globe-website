        <p>Here are the news headlines summarized:</br></br>1. **Turkish Strikes in Syria Cut Water to One Million People**: Turkish strikes have cut off water supplies to over one million people in northern Syria.</br>2. **Car Driven into Crowd Outside Primary School in China**: A car has been driven into a crowd outside a primary school in China, injuring several people.</br>3. **Trump Picks Former Congressman and Fox Host as Transport Secretary**: Former US President Donald Trump has picked Sean Duffy, a former congressman and Fox host, as his new transport secretary.</br>4. **Ukraine Fires US-Supplied Long Range Missiles into Russia**: Ukraine's defence ministry says it has fired US-supplied long-range missiles into Russian territory.</p>
        <p><i> A dramatic image of a sprawling cityscape under siege by war, with the faint outline of Turkish military aircraft in the sky above, as people struggle to access water from a broken pipe in the foreground, while in the background a chaotic scene unfolds outside a primary school in China where a car has crashed into the crowd, all set against the striking backdrop of a US-style highway, where a sleek transport vehicle zooms by with the flags of Ukraine and the US proudly displayed on its side, as flames rise from the nearby Russian border. </i></p>
